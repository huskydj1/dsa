## Fundamental Search Strategies

### BFS

One of the strengths of BFS ... shortest path problems 

### DFS

A strength of DFS is that its easy to extract paths and that it's easy to implement using recursion. 

## Applications

Graphs' flexible structure lends to a wide array of applications. We describe some common use-cases below: 

### Topological Sort

One of the problems 

### Strongly Connected Components

Suppose that you want to find friend groups ...
